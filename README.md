# leaflet-challenge

## Assignment
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Contents
This project contains a Leaflet map with markers displaying information for all earthquakes in the last 30 days.  
Each earthquake marker displays information for the location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake.
